# Magic Squares

This short python program is a solution to a programming challenge from the University of Waterloo's Canadian Computing Competition

## How the program works

1. The user is prompted to enter the size of the square (e.g '3' will create a 3x3 grid)

2. The grid is then displayed and the user is promted to enter numbers for each position

3. If the sum of all rows, columns and diagonals are the same, the message 'This is a Magic Square' will be displayed, otherwise the message 'This is not a Magic Square' will be displayed

4. The user is then prompted whether they would like to play again
